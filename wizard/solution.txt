First Question: What is the ASCII plaintext corresponding to this binary string? 
010110100110010101110010011011110111001100100000001001100010000001001111011011100110010101110011

pt = Zeros & Ones

Second Question: What is the ASCII plaintext corresponding to this hex string? 
4f6820776f77777721204261736520313020697320636f6f6c20616e6420616c6c2062757420486578787878

pt = Oh wowww! Base 10 is cool and all but Hexxxx

Third Question: What is the ASCII plaintext corresponding to this octal string?
(HINT: octal -> int -> hex -> chars) 
535451006154133420162312701623127154533472040334725553046256234620151334201413347444030460563312201673122016730267164

pt = We can represent numbers in any base we want

Fourth Question: What is the ACII representation of this integer? 
(HINT: int -> hex -> chars)
8889185069805239596091046045687553579520816794635237831028832039457

pt = This is one big 'ol integer!

Fifth Question: What is the ASCII plaintext of this Base64 string? 
QmFzZXMgb24gYmFzZXMgb24gYmFzZXMgb24gYmFzZXMgOik=

pt = Bases on bases on bases on bases :)

Last Question: What is the Big-Endian representation of this Little-Endian hex string? 
293a2065636e657265666669642065687420776f6e6b206f7420646f6f672073277449

hex (Big-Endian) = It's good to know the difference :)

Very well, my friend. Here is your reward for your witts: flag{c2ed35aba037cd93381b298caa2720ee}
